Playsation2 controller interface library for Arduino.

(Document revised Oct. 22, 2008)


This is my first C/C++ program.
Any kind of feed back sent to <gyokimae at hotmail com> is appreciated :-)

==============================================================================
1. Installting the library
==============================================================================

Like any other Arduino library, place the files under
<arduino path>/hardware/libraries/
and restart the Arduino IDE.



==============================================================================
2. Hardware pin layout
==============================================================================

There are many good guides on how the pins are layed out.

This one in particular also has a good description on the protocols used
to communicate with the controllers.
http://www.curiousinventor.com/guides/ps2


The pin layouts are currently hard-coded inside GPSX.c.


Arduino Pin No. | PSX Controller Pin No.
----------------+------------------------
Pin 7           | Pin 1 Data
Pin 6           | Pin 2 Command
                | Pin 3 9V for Motor (Optional)
                | Pin 4 GND
                | Pin 5 VCC (3.3V)
Pin 5           | Pin 6 Attention (PAD1)
Pin 4           | Pin 7 Clock
                | Pin 8 N/C
Pin 3           | Pin 9 ACK

Pin 2           | Pin 6 Attention (PAD2)


- If you connect only one controller, Pin 2 can be left open.
  Connections to all pins other than "attention" are shared by two
  controllers as they are designed to respond only when its "attention"
  pin drops low.

- You need a 9V external power source to drive the motors in DualShock
  controllers.

    If you choose to use the vibration motors, 
      > The Arduino board must run on a 9V AC adapter.
      > Connect Pin 3 of the controller to the "Vin" pin on your Arduino.

    If you choose NOT to use vibration motord,
      > Leave Pin 3 on the controller disconnected.
      > Run the board on the power source of your choice.


- The following pins require a 1k ohm pullup resister as illustrated below.
   * The "Attention" pins for pad1 and 2 (Arduino pins 2 & 5)
   * Data pin (Arduino pin 7)

                  Vcc 5V
                    |
                 (1kOhm)
                    |
   (Arduino Pin)----+----(Controller)


  *** All other pins can be connected directly to the pin sockets on Arduino.


To physically connect the controller to your Arduino board, you can either
chop off the connetor from one of the PS2 controllers, or take a socket from
junk hardware so you can easily plug in or replace the controllers.

In my case, I used a socket taken from a USB<->PS converter I had lying around.

Also, when using the internal high impedacne resister in the ATmega ports
instead of the external 1k ohm resister, it caused some timing issues I could
not over come.



==============================================================================
3. Function reference
==============================================================================

- Basically, for any function you need to specify which of the two controllers
  the command is ment to be received by.
  Use either one of the two macros, "PSX_PAD1" or "PSX_PAD2".

- Key states are updated only when the function "PSX.updateState(padNo)" is
  called.

- Changing the motor rotation speeds require two steps. First, set the state by
  calling "PSX.motor(<arguments>)".
  Changes take effect the next time you call PSX.updateState().




+------------------------+
| PSX.updateState(padNo) |
+------------------------+
  Poll key state

     padNo  = PSX_PAD1 | PSX_PAD2


    After calling the above function, you can use one of the following macros
    to get the key state.



      *** Check if key is pressed down ***
          Either an integer or zero will return.

      IS_DOWN_LEFT(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_DOWN(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_RIGHT(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_UP(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_START(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_STICK_RIGHT(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_STICK_LEFT(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_SELECT(padNo)

      IS_DOWN_SQUARE(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_CROSS(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_CIRCLE(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_TRIANGLE(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_R1(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_L1(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_R2(padNo)
      IS_DOWN_L2(padNo)


      *** Check if key has been pressed since last updateState()
          Either an integer or zero will return.

      PRESSED_LEFT(padNo)
      PRESSED_DOWN(padNo)
      PRESSED_RIGHT(padNo)
      PRESSED_UP(padNo)
      PRESSED_START(padNo)
      PRESSED_STICK_RIGHT(padNo)
      PRESSED_STICK_LEFT(padNo)
      PRESSED_SELECT(padNo)

      PRESSED_SQUARE(padNo)
      PRESSED_CROSS(padNo)
      PRESSED_CIRCLE(padNo)
      PRESSED_TRIANGLE(padNo)
      PRESSED_R1(padNo)
      PRESSED_L1(padNo)
      PRESSED_R2(padNo)
      PRESSED_L2(padNo)

      RELEASED_LEFT(padNo)
      RELEASED_DOWN(padNo)
      RELEASED_RIGHT(padNo)
      RELEASED_UP(padNo)
      RELEASED_START(padNo)
      RELEASED_STICK_RIGHT(padNo)
      RELEASED_STICK_LEFT(padNo)
      RELEASED_SELECT(padNo)


      *** Check if key has been released since last updateState()
          Either an integer or zero will return.

      RELEASED_SQUARE(padNo)
      RELEASED_CROSS(padNo)
      RELEASED_CIRCLE(padNo)
      RELEASED_TRIANGLE(padNo)
      RELEASED_R1(padNo)
      RELEASED_L1(padNo)
      RELEASED_R2(padNo)
      RELEASED_L2(padNo)


      *** Read value. An unsigned char (uint8_t) of a value between
          0 and 255 (0x00 to 0xFF) will return.

      ANALOG_RIGHT_X(padNo)
      ANALOG_RIGHT_Y(padNo)
      ANALOG_LEFT_X(padNo)
      ANALOG_LEFT_Y(padNo)



+----------------------------------------------------+
| PSX.motorEnable(padNo, Motor1Enable, Motor2Enable) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
  Enabling/disabling motors

     padNo         = PSX_PAD1 | PSX_PAD2

     Motor1Enable  = MOTOR1_ENABLE | MOTOR1_DISABLE

     Motor2Enable  = MOTOR2_ENABLE | MOTOR2_DISABLE



+----------------------------------------------------+
| PSX.motor(padNo, Motor1OnOff, uint8_t Motor2Speed) |
+----------------------------------------------------+
  Changing the motor's rotation speed

     padNo         = PSX_PAD1 | PSX_PAD2

     Motor1OnOff  = MOTOR1_ON | MOTOR1_OFF

     Motor2Speed  = uint8_t between 0 to 255 (0x00 to 0xFF)


  This function only sets the next value.
  Changes will take effect on next call of PSX.updateState().



+-----------------------------+
| PSX.mode(padNo, mode, lock) |
+-----------------------------+
 Switching Analog/Digital modes

     padNo  = PSX_PAD1 | PSX_PAD2

     mode   = MODE_DIGITAL | MODE_ANALOG

     lock   = MODE_UNLOCK | MODE_LOCK


  When the mode is set to "lock", the Analog key on the controller is
  disabled and locked to the mode specified.



==============================================================================
4. Pit falls I fell into during development
==============================================================================

Many web sites describe how the ACK pin is lowered by the controller after
each byte it receives successfully.
However, with the PS2 controllers, the duration of this tick is extremely
short and difficult to capture via polling within a loop.
After struggling for a couple of days to get the timing correct, I have
switched strategies to ignoring the ACK pin and sending the bytes in order
with a wait in between. This worked well, especially with another non-Sony
controller I owned.

The current version of this library simply reads 9 bytes. (Although I should
be able to avoid this by refering to the second returned byte indicating the
remaining length)



==============================================================================
5. Known issues
==============================================================================

* Currently, all timings are designed to work only on PS2 controllers.
  PS1 controllers are designed to run at half the clock speed wihch I haven't
  adjusted to yet.

* I actually have not tried running 2 controllers at the same time, but
  is expected to work theoritically.
